# Demand model

Percentage change of Q, and percentage change of P can be expressed in math as:

$$\frac{\Delta Q}{Q} = \frac{\Delta P}{P} \times \frac{P}{Q}$$

$$\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$$, 
where $Q$ is the quantity of orders in each month. 

$$\frac{\Delta P}{P}$$
where $P$ is the price of the representative items.

Consider the demand function as a log linear function:

$$\ln Q = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln P + \epsilon$$

where $\epsilon$ is the error term. 

In terms of percentage change, the demand function can be expressed as:

$$\frac{\Delta Q}{Q} = \beta_1 \frac{\Delta P}{P}$$

where $\beta_1$ is the elasticity of demand.
